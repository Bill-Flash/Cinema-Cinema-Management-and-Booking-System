# Cinema-Cinema-Management-and-Booking-System

## Description

This project will involve the design and implementation of a software system for the management of a cinema.
This will be a single user desktop application with a graphical user interface.
There are two parts to the software, an administrative panel that allows scheduling the movies that will be
shown and which screens they will be shown on and ticket panel that can be used by the staff to sell tickets to
the customers of the cinema. It is implemented as a single application.
